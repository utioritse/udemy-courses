# Udemy Course Analysis Visualization 

This documentation outlines the structure and implementation details for the Udemy course analysis dashboard. The visualization provides insights into course performance, revenue, and distribution across various categories. Udemy’s revenue is heavily driven by its web development courses, which teach skills for building websites, applications, and software systems. This dominance reflects the tech industry boom of the early-to-mid 2010s, when Silicon Valley investors funneled billions into technology startups across sectors—from e-commerce to fintech—spurring unprecedented demand for skilled developers. As companies raced to digitize, learners flocked to acquire these lucrative skills, Web development stands as the highest-earning subject, generating $630 million in revenue, while The Web Developer Bootcamp ranks as the top-grossing course, bringing in $24 million.
